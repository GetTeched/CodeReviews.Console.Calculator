 * For your second project you'll build a Console Calculator App with the help of Microsoft’s Documentation.
 * This project shouldn't be more difficult than the first, but you'll learn important skills such as having multiple
 * projects in a solution, writing to files, and debugging. It will also serve as practice in a very important skill
 * following written documentation. This is something you’ll be doing on a regular basis as a professional
 * developer, so it’s essential that you’re comfortable applying text-based instructions when developing software.
